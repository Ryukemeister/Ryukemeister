## Rajiv Sahal

A front-end developer who designs sleek interfaces and builds interactive websites that WOW people. There are days when I break my code, and there are days when my code breaks me. Nevertheless, the more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know, and that is what keeps me going as a developer. My current interests include learning React and exploring open source to hopefully contribute to it as much as I can.
