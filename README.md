## Rajiv Sahal

A front-end developer who designs sleek interfaces and builds interactive websites that WOW people. Some days I break my code, while on some days my code breaks me. But the more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know, and that's what keeps me going as a developer. My current interests include learning React and exploring open source in order to contribute as much as I can.
